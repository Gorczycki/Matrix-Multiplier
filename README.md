* Project to convert a C++ file to a website.
  User enters in two square matrices of any size,
  User then enters elements of these matrices,
  after entering, algorithm multiplies these two matrices and displays them.

* I've used MAMP to create the localhost site for testing and modification,
  and used Emscripten to generate the html, javascript, and webassembly files.
